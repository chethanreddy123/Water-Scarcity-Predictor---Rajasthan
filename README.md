## Problem Statement

Rajasthan, India faces a dire water crisis with over 80% of its villages experiencing water scarcity.
This has led to a significant increase in the number of water-related illnesses and deaths, especially among 
women and children who bear the responsibility of fetching water from distant sources. Despite numerous efforts by 
the government to address this issue, there is still a lack of reliable information on the availability and distribution of 
water resources across the state.

To combat this issue, there is a need for an effective water management system that provides accurate data and timely services 
to both the people and the government of Rajasthan. The proposed web app aims to address this need by offering a platform for 
citizens to book water services and for the government to use two critical tools:

1. Bore Well Location Predictor: This tool will assist the government in identifying the most suitable locations for bore
wells in Rajasthan's villages. With the help of advanced algorithms and data analytics, the tool will provide accurate predictions
based on geological data, water table depth, and other relevant factors. This will not only save time and resources but also 
ensure the sustainability of the bore wells by preventing overexploitation of groundwater resources.

2. Water Level Forecasting Tool: This tool will provide the government with a reliable forecast of water levels across the state. 
By analyzing data from various sources, including rainfall patterns, water usage, and other variables, the tool will predict water 
availability for the coming months. This information will be vital for the government to plan and implement effective water management 
policies and strategies.

Overall, the proposed web app has the potential to make a significant impact on the lives of people in 
Rajasthan by providing them with reliable water services and the government with critical tools to manage and conserve 
the state's precious water resources.
